# Dockerfile CMD Instruction Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the `CMD` instruction fails to start the application correctly.  The issue stems from a missing or incorrect execution context, leading to the application not running inside the container.

## Bug Report

The original `Dockerfile` attempts to start a Node.js application using the `CMD` instruction. However, it lacks a proper execution context and might have problems with paths or environment variables.  This leads to the container exiting with a non-zero exit code, indicating failure.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the application's entry point and its dependencies are properly configured within the Dockerfile. The `Dockerfile-solution` provides a corrected approach that utilizes an entrypoint to set up the environment and then uses the `CMD` instruction to actually start the app, ensuring the correct execution context.
